// To use server-side storage for storing tokens in Next.js, you can utilize session management libraries or implement your own server-side storage mechanism. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

// Choose a server-side storage mechanism: You can use session storage libraries like express-session, koa-session, or cookie-session to handle session management and storage. Alternatively, you can implement your own custom server-side storage using databases like Redis or a persistent file system.

// Set up server-side storage: Install the relevant session storage library and configure it with appropriate options, such as session secret, cookie settings, and storage options. This typically involves integrating the library with your Next.js server or custom server.

// Store the token: During the authentication process, once you have obtained the token, store it in the server-side storage mechanism. This can involve setting session variables, storing it in a database, or associating it with the user session.

// Retrieve the token: During server-side rendering, retrieve the token from the server-side storage mechanism. This could be done in your Next.js API routes, server middleware, or within your custom server logic.

// Pass the token to components: Once you have the token, you can pass it as a prop to the relevant components during server-side rendering. This allows the components to access the token and perform any necessary authentication or authorization tasks.

// Remember to handle scenarios where the token is not present or has expired to provide appropriate error handling or redirect the user to the login page.

// Please note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on the session storage library or custom server-side storage mechanism you choose. Consult the documentation of the selected library for detailed instructions on setting up and using server-side storage in your Next.js application.
